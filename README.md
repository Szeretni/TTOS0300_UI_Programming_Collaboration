# .NET WPF game project with an external MySQL server

User Interface Programming and Databases courses' project. We created a Monopoly-boardgame clone.

Front is a C# .NET WPF UI with several layers. Game data is maintained in MySQL database which is on Raspberry Pi in an external network. Internet connection is required. The database is no longer running, so the game cannot be played.
